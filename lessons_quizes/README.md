# Intro to Machine Learning

Machine learning brings together computer science and statistics to harness that predictive power.

This class teaches the end-to-end process of investigating data through a machine learning lens. It taught me how to extract and identify useful features that best represent data, a few of the most important machine learning algorithms including Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Trees and unsupervised learning, and how to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms.


## Project - Identifying Fraud at Enron Using Emails and Financial Data

The goal of this project was to build a prediction model to identify persons-of-interest (POI’s.) using scikit learn, numpy, and pandas modules in Python. The target of the predictions were persons-of-interest (POI’s) who were individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement, or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity. Financial compensation data and aggregate email statistics from the Enron Corpus were used as features for prediction.
